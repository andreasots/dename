must = our code has to ensure
should = holds if everyone correct, our code must verify

no client rqs must be routed to a round after it is closed for clients; they should go into a subsequent round instead
no publish messages should arrive before we commit to our queue because no correct server would continue without verifying the commitment
no new pushes or commits should arrive after all the acks have arrived
