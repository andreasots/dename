Description
===========

`dnmgr` is a command line utility for managing `dename` profiles. Dename is a
decentralized system that securely maps usernames to profiles which can contain
any information the user wishes. For example, it can serve as a public key
infrastructure, a store of electronic business cards or as a domain name system.
In this context, *secure* means that everybody who looks up a name sees the same
profile. This guarantee holds if any one of the `dename` servers is correct, and
as the servers are run on different infrastructure by different entities, we
expect this to be the case in all foreseeable future.

Using `dnmgr`
-------------

If this is the first time you are using `dename`, you need to create a new
account. The easiest way to do this is to type `dnmgr init` and follow the
instructions. You will be asked to enter an email address and receive a message
on it -- this policy is in place to prevent one person from grabbing very many
names. After this, you will be able to pick any name that is not already taken.

        dnmgr init

The `dename` configuration, including the secret key used to modify the
public profile, is by default stored in `~/.config/dename`. **Please make sure
nobody else is able to get their hands on the contents of this directory** -- if
they could, they would be able to change your profile, which would lead to
various nasty consequences depending on how it is used. For example, if the
profile stores contact information, they would be able to redirect messages sent
to you.

`dnmgr set *FIELD* *CONTENT*`
:   Set a field in the current profile. The field can be specified by either a
    human-readable field name, if it is known to this program, or by an
    unambiguous numerical identifier. For example, to publish your ssh public
    keys on your profile, either of the following will do:

        dnmgr set ssh "$(cut -d' ' -f-2 ~/.ssh/id_*.pub)"
        dnmgr set 22  "$(cut -d' ' -f-2 ~/.ssh/id_*.pub)"

    Similarly, to include ssh host identification keys, use either of:

        dnmgr set ssh-host "example.com $(cut -d' ' -f-2 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub)"
        dnmgr set 21       "example.com $(cut -d' ' -f-2 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub)"
