# Dename

Dename is a decentralized system that securely maps usernames to profiles which
can contain any information the user wishes. For example, it can serve as a
public key infrastructure, a store of electronic business cards or as a domain
name system.  In this context, *secure* means that everybody who looks up a name
sees the same profile.

See [user](https://github.com/andres-erbsen/dename/blob/master/doc/dnmgr.txt), [lookup](https://github.com/andres-erbsen/dename/blob/master/doc/dnmlookup.txt) and [server](https://github.com/andres-erbsen/dename/blob/master/doc/server-operators-guide.txt) documentation and the list of [currently allowed email addresses](https://github.com/andres-erbsen/dename/blob/master/tokenserver/tokenserver.go#L110). Any server that issues at most 3
addresses per person could be on that list, contact me to get yours added.
